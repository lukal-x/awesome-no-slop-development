Lists

- [projects](#projects)
- [people](#people) and
- [companies](#companies)

that are brave enough to stand up and publicly say they've given "gen AI" a chance but are moving on.

At my dayjob it's mandated and I try really hard to make use of it in good faith, outside of work I skip it altogether, I don't even see it competing with (functional) search engines. I've experimented with MCPs a lot, not even that seems to lead anywhere.

---

Yes starting this list absolutely is necessary because it is a literal case of bystander effect where everyone's too afraid of

- appearning dismissive, or
- being proven wrong in some unspecified near future, or
- simply being ostracized for believing their own eyes over some shill

and many are talking about it in private but still, good luck finding a company advertising their products as no-"AI" or advertising that they don't use some kind of model to write the software that handles your passwords and your credit card info just to brand themselves as modern.

Also having this list can help you make decisions between projects to participate in, products to purchase, or people and companies employ/join.

I'll look into categorizing or tagging the cause between something like [licensing], [ethical], [legal], [quality], [other] etc.
