Lists

- [projects](#projects)
- [people](#people) and
- [companies](#companies)

that are brave enough to stand up and publicly say that THE EMPEROR HAS NO CLOTHES.

Expand the list if you are not afraid to say that you've given "gen AI" a chance, you didn't see any useful results, and that your're moving on.

Yes starting this list absolutely is necessary because it is a literal case of bystander effect where everyone's too afraid of

- appearning dismissive, or
- being proven wrong in some unspecified near future, or
- simply being ostracized for believing their own eyes over some shill

and everyone's talking about it in private but still, good luck finding a company advertising their products as no-"AI" or advertising that they don't use some kind of model to write the software that handles your passwords and your credit card info just to brand themselves as modern.

Also having this list can help you make decisions between projects to participate in, products to purchase, or people and companies employ/join.
